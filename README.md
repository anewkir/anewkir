ðŸ”­ Hello, my name is Avery. Currently, I am persuing my Bachlors in Computer Science as a non-traditional student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Welcome!

âš¡I have a great passion for expanding my knowledge about different programming languages and technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest updates. As a life long learner, its intresting to learn about new open source technologies and how they work.

ðŸ˜„ Apart from technology, I take pleasure in spending time with my loved ones, playing video games, and delving into manga. Kirby games hold a special place in my heart and currently, my top pick for manga is Jujitsu Kaisen.
